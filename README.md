Enabling seamless communication as we move ahead

Paul and Phil: Recommending that we use GIT-Hub to provide files that we will need to be exchanged as well as to document
the endeavor.

As we move ahead, my challenge will be to add Promxxx content to my demo and learning lab. Paul's challenge will be to provide
timely exchange of required files, as well as fresh contact as needed. We can also handle beta-content as that becomes available.

Let's make this partnership come together.
